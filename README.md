# Hack-without-port-forwarding
Hack any were without Router (hack by sim hotspot)

in this Tutorial i m going to show you how to forward a port
from a mobile hotspot or usb thetering.SIM providers
doesnot allow us to forward a port so we need router 
but in this tutorial i m going to teach you how we can forward a port without router

the Tool name is : NGROK

First step you must download and setup ngrok from this link:

ngrok: https://ngrok.com

Step 2: Start tunneling from your custom port
in your command line type : ./ngrok tcp 4444
note : 4444 is my custom port 
so you see Forwarding part 
in forwarding part first part is your wan ip & wan port and in secound part you see lan ip & lan port

Good Luck
